This project produces a simple website, Odin Recipes, which displays three different recipes. The main webpage is a home page that links to the webpage of each recipe. 

For this project, I applied basic HTML, including the HTML boilerplate, as well as different elements (e.g. <a>, <img>, <ul>, <ol>) and attributes (e.g. href, rel, src, alt).
